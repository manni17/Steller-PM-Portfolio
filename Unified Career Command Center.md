## PHASE 0: RECONNAISSANCE & ALIGNMENT

**Goal:** Do not touch the resume until you know exactly which "Lens" to use.

### Step 1: The "Day-in-the-Life" Simulation
Before writing, answer these three questions about the target role:
1.  **The Daily Grind:** Will I spend 80% of my time in Jira (Product), Excel/Audits (Quality), or PowerPoint (Strategy)?
2.  **The Currency of Success:** Does this company measure success by Revenue Generated (Product Lens) or Risk Mitigated (Quality Lens)?
3.  **The Hidden Standard:** Is there a "Shadow Requirement"? (e.g., Nuclear roles require "Safety Culture"; Startups require "Founder Energy").

### Step 2: Volatility & Velocity Checks
*   **The Volatility Index:** Is this role building something new (High Volatility -> Module A/E) or protecting something that exists (Low Volatility -> Module C)?
*   **The 15-Minute Rule:** If you cannot identify the primary "Lens" within 15 minutes, default to Module C (Stability) to maintain momentum.

### Step 3: Framework Retrieval (The Selector Logic)

| IF the Day-to-Day is... | AND the Industry is... | THEN Activate this Framework... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Roadmaps, Strategy, Growth | SaaS, Fintech, AI | **Module A: Product Builder** |
| Audits, Compliance, SOPs | Nuclear, Construction, Gov | **Module B: Quality Guardian** |
| Risk Transfer, SLAs, Uptime | Banking, Telecom, Regulated | **Module C: Stability & Risk** |
| Data Analysis, SQL, Logistics | Amazon, Logistics, High-Tech | **Module D: Data/Supply Chain** |
| **Crisis Mgmt, Tech Rescue, Coding** | **Startups, Turnarounds, AI** | **Module E: AI & Crisis Ops** |

## SECTION 4: EXECUTION SCRIPTS

### Cover Letter Block: The "AI Augmentation" (For Tech Roles)
"In my most recent role, I faced a critical 'Bus Factor' risk with a single developer in a conflict zone. Rather than pausing operations, I leveraged **AI Agents (Comet/Gemini)** to reverse-engineer our codebase, generating 100% accurate architectural documentation and establishing a local 'Digital Twin' environment. This experience taught me that modern Product Management is not just about requirements—it's about **technical resourcefulness** and ensuring business continuity through innovation."

### Cover Letter Block: The "Why Me" (Hybrid)
"I sit at the intersection of **Engineering Reality** and **Business Strategy**. While many candidates can write a ticket, I bring the ability to translate technical debt (like microservices complexity) into business risk ($1M churn), ensuring technical execution always serves business goals."
